Its a gambrel roof barn, so its a lot of work to get those trusses up there, but we had a crew to come together one day, one Saturday in June of 1985 and we put the roof on in one day, we put all the trusses up and the boards on the roof. Assembled all that and then from there I finished the barn myself. I did the initial work of setting up the frame and then when we needed the help a crew came in for a RLA workday and we set up the trusses and got the roof boards on and then I completed the barn and was able to put hay in that season, by mid July I was able to put hay in the barn.""","Scanned at 800ppi on Epson 1000XL scanner as 48-bit RGB uncompressed TIFF images.

They are large 4 story brick building some 200 feet long by 40 wide and these are divided of into room large enough to contain 100 men with sleeping bunks. Each bunk will accommodate 3 persons which leave them a blanket to lay on and two over them so that we sleep very comfortable. I have not slept cold a night yet. 2nd I will endeavor to describe the wooden or rear barracks where we were stationed first. They are wooden buildings 500 feet long by 24 wide 1 story high divided of[f] into apartments large enough to account over 200 men and each building will accommodate 1100 men and there is 2400 men stationed here now but I do not know how long we shall be here. They say we shall go in two or three weeks. In the 3rd place, I will describe the kitchen. That is a room about 30 by 40 feet. In it are six large boilers as large as your Chasldro kettle in which our victuals are cooked. They cut up the meat into pieces and throw it into these kettles and then they turn a faucet let a stream of water on and when the kettle is full they throw in a pan of salt and [heat] it up and let it boil and then it is taken out and the meat cutters take it and cut it all of[f] from the bones and then it is thrown in to barrels to keep warm till used. After it stands till they are afraid it will spoil then they make a soup of it. We have pudding and molasses two or three times a week as you make it at home They heat three of these kettles full of water and then they turn a little faucet and let a small stream of water run in and one takes the pudding stick on one a pan of meal and they go at it. It takes about an hour to to make a kettle full. They use about 15 barrels of meat and three hundred loaves of bread and 25 bushels of potatoes a day here. In the 4 place we will go into the mess room. This will seat six hundred men at a time in them. There is places to wash our dishes. We do not wash our own dishes yet. We appoint waiter for that. 5th will now give you a little sketch of the routine business of a soldier here. I will give you my experience since Jan 1st. On this day we marched down to the city to see the governer and to pace through the G-- place of residence while he stays here which is a very magnificent building. There is some very nice buildings here. One very large and beautiful church. At six the drum is beat to wake up the soldiers. At a half of past it beats for breakfast. At 9 for company and squad drill. At half a past 12 is for dinner. At 2 for battalion Drill. At half-past 4 dress parade. At six supper and at nine the ______ and then at half a past nine every light is to be blown out. On the first went to the city. On the 3rd stood guard--- nothing more but the general routine till the tenth Then I was on guard duty. 13th on guard. On the night of the 10 I went to a sabbath school concert where they had 300 singers and the band of the 76th regiment now station hear It was in Twerdel hall. They estimate the audience at between 4 & 5000 people and the girls were all dressed in white with a red white and blue sash and a most every singer had a flag and they had about a dozen large flags. It was the most splendid thing I ever saw. Soldiers admission was 15 cents, citizens 25 cents. Last Saturday and Sunday it thawed and what little snow we had went of. On Sunday night it snowed a little so that there was about as many sleighs as wagons used To day it is snowing and there is a prospect of having good sleighing. We have not had any cold weather hear to speak of. The father of one of the boys that came hear with us came this morning after him and he has gone now to see the officers.

I went and see them and I told him that I would take all of them and he said he did not want any money. He would take it out of the mill or off from the farm.

On Sunday the 8 we advanced about 4 miles where we met the enemy in armed battle full but we made them get up and get and soon advanced to Beatton Station Brandy Station. And I think they travailed about as fast as we did. On the 11th of last month jest 4 weeks from the same day the rebs were driving us like fun. I guess we took more prisoners than they did. You must recollect that there is 7 corps in the army of the Potomac and one by one crossed at Kelleys fort The 6 corps crossed a Rapaghanmack Station and they had pretty warm time crossing but they captured some 8 hundred prisoners 9 pieces of artillery there. What our loss was I could not say but I guess heavy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think there is not the least doubt but what there will be a battle fought before long in this army but where or when I cannot say I think our corps course is now towards Richmond. If we are not defeated I think there will be no halt made until we pull up in front of that city. We are now only 6 miles from Culpepper. And the rebs are hurrying back as fast as possible. We have now about 6 pieces of large guns with each corps and we are fully prepared to make an advance. About 20,000 of our cavalry and one corps of infantry hv. gone to Fredricksburg by the way of Falmouth. What they are arguing to do that way I do not know. I am well and feel first-rate. An active campaign agrees with me first rate. I always feel better. I have not got my Box yet and a good many of the boys have got boxes in the same place. There has no boxes been delivered to the army of the Potomac since we left Culpepper. ___________ ___________ is onward to Richmond.

I wrote you a letter a few days ago and I was in such a hurry I did not half write it, and you may never have got it, so I will give you a little account of the proceedings since a week ago yesterday. On that day I had just started out to go and get some washing done as I heard the bugle sound the officer call and I stopped to see what was the matter and we got ordered to pull up stakes and travail again. We left our old camp at North Mountain at 5 P.M. and marched to Martinsburg an[d] to our old camp ground there and it commenced raining and it rained for about two hours. We lay on the ground there all night. Everything was in an uproar[.] All the union people were picking their duds and (skedadling) to Maryland. Everything was quiet with us until about 9 oclock in the morning when we were called into line as quick as possible (the boys were feeling as well as ever they did,) We marched out on the Winchester [road] and about two miles when we commenced skirmishing with the enemy and we keep that up all day[.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"About 5, oclock the boys began to get discouraged thinking they would not have a chance to fight in company but about a half an hour before sunset they changed their minds for they opened upon us with three batteries and the shot and shell began to fall among us like hail. And then you might as well think some of the boys began to think about as much of home as was at the time they opened fire upon us[.] They also charged on the town with their cavalry and they gave one of the d-est yells you ever heard come from human beings. Perhaps you would like to know where I was all this time. Well I was with the regiment and when they commenced shelling us the left wing was out supporting 4 pieces of malbies [Maulsbys] battery (which is all captured exeep [except] one piece which we brought off with us on our retreat) and when the rebs charged on the town they limbered up to shift theys position so to fire up on the town[.] At that time we were called into line of battle for the purpose of changing our position so as to support the cannon. And when we began to change then was the time that they throwed everything at us that would kill men[.] They threw railroad iron at us as well as solid shot, and a lieutenant of the 126th his Regt said they put in a smal[l] black smith shop (such as we use in the army). Sledgehammer and anvil and all the tools, and threw [them] at him[.] He said he could put up with railroad iron and shells well enough but the blacksmith shop was more than he could stand.

If I recollect correctly[,] I left off where we started on our retreat Sunday night. Well we made our way as fast as possible to the banks of the Potomac at Shepardstown where we forded the river about 12 at night, it being 11 miles from Martinsburg. At the time we crossed the river about one half of our regiment was straggling behind. I kept with the regiment up to the crossing. I then fell out being tired and lame. I went about a mile down the river after crossing and then lay down by the side of the road for the rest of the night where I laid and slept until sunrise. I then got up and proceeded on my way. I soon came up with another squad that were stopped to guard the battery until a boat could be sent up from the ferry to get the cannon. This was in the neighborhood of the Antietam fight. I took my breakfast at Antietam. The battle was about two miles from the mill which is called the Antietam mill. It is a large flouring mill built of stone and is on Antietam creek. After I got my breakfast I in company with a fellow soldier took the most direct route to the ferry where we arrived about 5oclock P.M. The regiment being there about 2 hours before us. We then lay quiet enough until Wednesday morning when we were called up (that is our company and company K) about an hour before day and we sent up to the highest point of the higthes [heights] to support the artillery there and we had to chop down timber all that day and everything was preparing for a battle. We came down from the hgthes [heights] about 6oclock and there soon came on a heavy thunderstorm which lasted about two hours. It cleared off and was very warm. On Thursday there was a line of battle established and a line of rifle pits thrown up about one mile long. Nothing unusual transpiring until night when there was another very heavy shower which finely [finally] dwindled away [to] a good steady rain and it rained almost steadily for 20 hours at least. Between 9 & 10 oclock that night our pickets gave an alarm accidently which put our camp in an uproar. Every man was called out in line of battle and ordered into the rifle pits where we sttod [stood] all night in the rain. Began to be somewhat cold before morning and it was the hardest night the 106 ever saw soldiering. And the next morning I was detailed to work on the fert [fort] where we worked all day throwing up fertifycations [fortifications]. Our clothes were all wet through and through and in this condition we lay down to get a little rest and the next morning we were called out at three in the morning to be ready for any emergency so the rebs could not surprise us in the morning, for you must know that the rebs camp is in sight of [us] and we are expecting a morning attack some of these fine mornings. Saturday morning the rebels camp is reported to be in sight. In fact I saw a that has just been up on the higthes [heights] where they have a glass that they can see at a distance with and he says that he saw the camp of the rebs about six miles distance and that if the rebs do not get away before morning they will be helped away. We are still engaged in chopping down the woods around here (and many a fine cherry tree has been cut down too). I cut cherry trees down that was 16 inches through on the stump and there was 3 or 4 bushels of cherries on them about one half ripe. (This is the season for cherries here) Sunday morning the rebs camp is moved up the river about three miles. They are jest across the river from Shepardstown. Everything continues about the in camp[.] we are still throwing up rifle pits and building fertifycation [fortifications]. someing the rebs still continue to move off. They have been into Penn. capturing horses and cattle and have them yarded at Hagerstown, so says report and are engaged in building a pontoon bridge to take their plunder across. I think there will be a stop put to this before long. I think they will get themselves into a trap before they get back to Fredericksburg. I do not think there will be an attack made on this place now. I think we shall have to go out and fight them in the open field yet and put them in mind of Antietam again. I think that if you do not hear of a battle you may make up your mind to hear of one about the fourth of July between that and the tenth. Tuesday afternoon June 23rd 1863. We have just been I battalion drill to show the soldiers at this place where drilling first sprung from. I think we are now capable of beeting [beating] anything in the survise drilling. Our regiment is getting small. I think we have only 500 men fit for duty now and you know that we started 1010 men from old Camp Wheeler. Our troops that were at Winchester were pretty badly cut to pieces. One regiment that went in to the fight 800 strong came out with 19 men and one Major and the 87 only had about 140 men left. I suppose we lost upwards of 4 thousand there. Those that did escape had to cut their way out for the rebs had them entirely serrounded [surrounded], it is reported today that the rebs have crossed in to Maryland 40,000 strong. Put it down at half that number at [and] then you have a large force. I think their forces can better be put down at that. I believe that they have about 75 thousand now in all in Maryland and our colonel told us tonight that if we were attact [attacked] at this place it would be in about within 4 days. And he said he thought that they would yet make an attack on this place for they are moving their train this way, for one of our boys was up looking through the glass and he say[s] their baggage train about 5 miles long moving into Maryland.

I have seen quite a number of young girls a [and] women since I came to Martinsburg but they were some of those firey (seesh) which seem to look upon a yankey as being beneath the black slaves of this country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Feb 6th,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It is just six months to day since I enlisted and last night I was arrested and put it in the guard house, for not being present at roll call. It was quite stormy and I was down in company B with one of noncommissioned officers and he said that thare would not be any rool calls so that we need not be in any hurry. It was not long before a sergeant with a file of men came after me, so I had to stay in the guard house till this morning. I was a little vexed for this reason that I should be reported and the officer was not, for he was obliged to answer as well as myself. But never mind. I will have revenge if it is not till the last day I am in the army. If I live I will show them a trick worth two of those that they placed on me. I have some rather bad news to write. One of those Tyler boys died this morning at a private house. It was the youngest one, he was taken sick with the measles about three weeks ago. Before he got through with them, he was taken with the long fever which he has had twice before but this time he was taken. Thare has been I think 18 cases of measles in this regiment and there has been three cases where they turned into a fever and they have all three died. Tyler makes that 4 that have died in our company and 28 that have died in the regiment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thursday morning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This afternoon I went to dig the grave of David C Tyler it being the first grave that I ever helped to dig. I am tonight watching with the corps he died at a private house in this place. The people are real good union people. There is three others of our company sick here now. Davids brother would not go up stairs to sleep tonight, not even with me so the lady of the house has had his bed brought down for him it being a moveable bed fit for one man to sleep on. She also brought out a dish of apples and passed them around and then she passed around some good apple pie, the best I have tasted since I left home. I have also seen three cutters and one double team pass by with bells which taken with the pie reminds me very strong of home and some of the good times I have enjoyed about there, and I hope I may yet see them again. About 5 oclock tonight I heard of George Black . He died in the hospital at Harpers Ferry I believe on Tuesday last. I believe I wrote you that he got his discharge and came here from the hospital at Cumberland to get his papers which ware all made out and had been to Washington and signed and he was to have started for home in a few days at best as soon as the boys would get some things ready that they wanted to send but now he is in the grave. But it is only where we have all got to go sooner or later. And I do not know how soon I shall have to go but if it is my lot to die here why so be (Doctor skin) __ cant save me if he wished to. But I do not think he would try very hard. He never has tried very hard yet to save any one for I think if the last two boys had proper care when they were first taken down here might have been alive now. No more. Write soon D.W.

To think the man has not got more common sence than to make such an expression as edit such things in his paper, for ever since I have been in the army of the potomac I have not seen a time but that the men had rather lay still than march with their accootrements an neither has any other person[.] Thare is lots of jest such persons through the country that pretend to know all about the feeling of the mass of soldiers in the field but they never venture out into the army. they are to fraid but at the same time the soldiers do not want to go in to winter quarters.

Any attempt to process the body of your gallant son at present would be futile. The Army is at present some 30 miles from the place of his death. Since his fall (the 12th day of May) the operation of the Union Army has been a series of battles, hundreds, I might say thousands of soldiers are still unburied. Darwin had a soldiers burial. Myself and another man brought him of the field under a hot fire of the enemy into a pine grove. There the bayonets of his comrades under the supervision of his captain carved out a grave. It was all we could do under the circumstances. He was hardly covered up when we had to come into line to resist an attack the enemy. There are not many in the company for whom the Captain would have asked so much. I am neither husband nor father, but I can understand the feelings of a mother under such trying circumstances. And I pledge myself on the honor of an Englishman and Soldier to return to his grave as soon as possible and ascertain what can be done. Since Darwins death more than half the remainder of the company were killed or wounded in one action. Remember that in terrible times like the present it is the brave that are sacrificed to their countrys honor. And the time must come when the coward and [pattroon] will have to die to. Darwin was respected and beloved by us all. Loyal Washburn his comrade will write to you as soon as a chance opens.

I had to go on picket Sunday so I did not write. We are making every preparation for a move today. They have sent most of the woolen blankets off to Alexandria but I did not send any. I think of sending a box home. If I can a soldier to take one to Washington for me. Then all have to leave on a Tuesday. General Grant is putting everything out of the way but fighting men and then I guess there will be something done. You say you have not heard from John yet. Well I have. I had a letter from him more than a week ago and he said he had written to you first. So I guess you have got the full proceedings on this. He was ___ sick and he may but it cured him of his other sickness. His health was good when he wrote to me. You tell Mrs. Pickert that I should like an answer to that letter I wrote to her and Alonzo. I have not had time to answer that note I received enclosed in your letter about three weeks ago now but will do so soon. I did answer it by mail and am looking for one myself now. I am sorry about Austins cutting his hand now just as he is about to commence his spring work. You must tell him to do the best he can now seeing we are all off to war. I think he had better sow a good piece of flax for it is coming into use in the Army. We have just hawn [hewn] new tents made of flax at least they are good linen. I think people will _______ homemade clothes after this war. I see that wool and cotton is very high in the markets. I am pleased to hear the girls are trying to learn to spin and work up the flax. I have not time to answer the girls letters tonight but will do so soon. I had another letter from friend Wells a few days ago. You will look for a box from me soon. I shall send Austin another blanket for his horses. I suppose Austin will have to hire some this season but encourage him to do the best he can, and I will send some money, all I can to help along with things at home.

Your Dear John is no more. The place he once filled in the family circle will never again be occupied by him. Sincerely do I condole with the dear ones at home whose hearts are made desolate by this sad bereavement. Words of mine can afford little consolation to the aching hearts of Father & Mother[,] relatives & friends. But it may be some alleviation to their deep grief to know that in his last sickness he received good attendance + kind nursing. The Army or hospital Chaplain informed you by last mail of his death + of his disease Smallpox. I presume he also gave you some accounts of his last moments. he seemed reconciled to the will of God and died I am told with a fervent hope of Salvation through Christ Jesus. It is sad to think that he So young must die and sadder still that he should die so far form home and that the only relatives he had near home could not be permitted to solace his last moments. As neither myself nor any of my family have ever had the smallpox we were not permitted to visit him before or after death. But a Lady friend of ours who has had the disease visited him at our request every other day and provided every thing that was necessary in the way of delicacies. Such as were allowed and also saw that he was faithfully attended by the nurses. Another Lady visited the hospital on alternate days who was requested by our friend to look particularly after John. So that he had some one interested in him daily besides the hospital nurses. The day before he died our kind friend sat with him all the afternoon. It was the turning point in the disease and she gave us very little hope of his surviving. She sent for the chaplain who visited him and was with him several hours before his death which occurred on the next day before our friend again saw him. He lies buried in the soldiers cemetery on the Memorable Plains of Chalmeth may he rest in peace and may he who careth for all his works comfort the hearts of his surviving friends. I suppose he wrote you that he staid at my house as long as the surgeon in charge at the St Louis Hospital would allow him. He was nearly well of the chronic diarrhea when he left and if he had not taken the small pox I think he would in a little time have been permanently cured. When he left us he was put to nursing in the hospital + kept on it until he was attacked by his fatal disease. As soon as he found his disease was the smallpox he sent a note to his cousin John Bislan. Informing us of it and desiring if any of us had had the disease to call + see him. He afterwards expressed much satisfaction that we did not come although he wished to see us yet he requested our friend to tell us not to come. Dear Boy he did not know that we could not be admitted. He was very glad when we sent some one to see him as he was afraid we would not learn where he was. We will try and get some of his clothing from the hospital though we do not know that we can succeed. I should have written you sooner but there has been no mail since the morning after his death and I did not hear of it in time to write by that mail. Adieu my Dear Sister, do not let this sad loss grieve you too much remember that what is your loss was his gain and that it was the will of Our Heavenly Father that called him hence, doubtless for some wise purpose. I know you can not help mourning for him, it is natural and light that you should but do not let the thought enter your heart that our merciful Father afflicts you unjustly or too severely. Ask of Him and he will give you strength to sustain you through this Second Ordeal. go to him for consolation he will have pity on your + will enable you earnestly to Exclaim Thy will be done.

On Saturday the 19th there was heavy fighting from 2pm until after dark resulting in a general and bloody repulse of the enemy from all fronts; besides the loss of ten guns and thirteen hundred (1300) prisoners. Sunday morning, Sept. 20, came bright and glorious and both armies got up from the ground to renew the conflict. At 9am the enemy, relying on his favorite movement, concentrated and massed his focus to crush our center. Our artillery was massed also and occupied a splendid position on the hills and as the long, massed and splendid lines advanced under cover of their own artillery they were met by a combined and destructive fire of artillery and musketry from our extreme front. Still they advanced in fine order but our men were getting the range and while we suffered comparatively little, the rebels fell in heaps. Huge gaps were opened in their ranks at every discharge; they rallied, closed up and again advanced. For nearly three hours the battle raged thus, the rebel officers making desperate efforts to hurl their massed thousands on us and break our center. Officers and men fell in heaps, our artillery splendidly worked and maneuvered slaughtered them unmercifully. The continuous roar of musketry almost drowned that of the artillery and was most destructive on the enemy. At 12 N the enemy seeing he could not break our center retired, leaving his heaps of slain on our hands; and at 4pm again renewed the conflict by an attack on our right- more fierce and desperate, if possible, than was that of the morning. From that time till 8pm the fighting was terrific. The ground and adjacent heights were repeatedly lost and won and the enemys knowledge of the country gave him the advantage in this particular -----But an extended description would be tedious and you have doubtless seen it in this. The Army of the Cumberland is now entrenched in the fine fortifications left by Bragg, and our position is such that the whole combined (Confederacy?) cannot dislodge us. They had in this battle Longstreet and (Ewell?) [Sewell?] from Va, with 30,000 troops. They have terribly suffered in killed and wounded.

I have a very kind, good letter from your noble parents, written by your kind mother, a short time since, and have certainly read nothing more welcome in a long time. You must thank your kind mother for me, Darwin, in one of your letters home; I could not sufficiently express my gratitude in mine.  The 11th and 12 corps of your army are here- I notice in their organization (eighteen?) N.Y. regiments. We expect reinforcements from Grant every day; and soon will push ahead, drive the rebs out of Georgia and have railroad connection between Nashville and Savannah, complete. We (our cavalry) have recently captured 2000 of rebel cavalry with 12 cannon and gave them a severe drubbing killing and wounding a large number. The rebel Genl Wheeler with about 5000 cavalry crossed the river in the night with the intention of making an extensive raid a la John Morgan into (Tenn.?) but a division of our cavalry corps of Hoosiers followed, overtook, and soundly thrashed him, and we are still on his track. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I hope your health still continues good. There is nothing that promotes good health in the army more than cleanliness. I have actually known hundreds to die of nastiness and I never knew a man to be attacked with a virulent or chronic diarrhea (and that is the soldiers greatest enemy) who used cold water and the sponge occasionally. During the year that I was in the field with the regiment I was not sick a single day; but had I lain down and wallowed in the dirt as others did I should now like them be in an unknown grave. You have too much good sense to think that I make any personal application here, but has a friend writing to a friend, I would say to you if you wish to preserve your health, and bring a sound mind and body home to the anxious friends who are watching and waiting for your return  bathe periodically and never drink any Army whiskey for there isnt a constitution on earth that could stand the latter. It may seem strange, but it is never the less true, that I drank more liquor in three months in civil life than I have during the 28 months I have been in the army.  You must not delay as long as I do in writing. Fred Vandewaters wrote me lately  he is at school in Potsdam. Emma also wrote me. Charly Johnson is at school at the Falls. There was, I understand, great elation at (Fentons?) marriage. By the way I dont much admire those southern widows you described so well in your letter. They chew altogether too much snuff and eat too much day. Pah! makes a fellow nearly sick. I will write you at more length next time.
